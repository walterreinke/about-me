      <h2>Here are a few fun facts about me:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I am 19 years old, and was born on October 3.</li>
        <li>I was born in Wake Forest, North Carolina.</li>
        <li>
          While I grew up living without a sibling, I have a half-brother named
          Nick who is 36.
        </li>
        <li>
          I love crime shows. I've seen most of the Law and Order episodes from
          the 90s.
        </li>
        <li>
          One of my hobbies is playing video games. I spend a lot of my free
          time playing games with my friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          My favorite sport to watch is NBA basketball (my favorite team is the
          Dallas Mavericks), but my favorite sport to play is golf. My dad
          taught me how to play at a young age, and I've recently starting
          playing again with my friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          I grew up going to afterschool programs and summer camps at the local
          YMCA. Three summers ago, I became a camp counselor at the camp I spent
          my summers at growing up.
        </li>
        <li>
          My counselor nickname at camp is Pharaoh, which I got after telling
          everyone that my favorite movie is The Prince of Egypt (which is no
          longer true).
        </li>
        <li>
          I love watching movies. Some of my best memories with my friends are
          from watching movies together.
        </li>
        <li>Like most people, I really like listening to music.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Career Goals:</h2>
      <p>
        Politics is one of my passions. Talking about politics is one of the
        things I enjoy doing most (most of the time). Before coming to college,
        I was trying to figure out a way to get a political science degree and
        not have to move back in with my parents after college. I decided that
        double majoring in journalism and political science would allow me to
        get paid to talk about politics. I really enjoy making videos,
        specifically the video editing process, so I would like to go into some
        form of visual journalism and take part in the video making process,
        whether that means being the reporter in the video, being a producer, or
        being an editor. I aspire to work for a company like Vice, that makes
        videos on national and international politics and also does a lot of
        great investigative journalism.

          >Andrew Callaghan</a

        idols and I would love to do something similar to what he does some day.

          >Hasan Piker</a
        >, a political commentator and streamer, is another one of my idols and
        has my dream job: getting paid to talk about politics and play video
        games.

    <h2>Here's a video I made for one of my journalism classes:</h2>
    <p>
      These are the types of videos that I would like to make in the future. I
      love the video making process, and I specifically love making these sorts
      of videos, where as a journalist, I can give a voice to somebody else's
      experience. I also think investigative journalism is best presented in a
      video format.
